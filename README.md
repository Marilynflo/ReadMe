These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

NFL Stats

This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the purposes of fantasy football. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
